# Air_Traffic

The code and example data are created by Haoran Meng (h2meng@ucsd.edu) and Yehuda Ben-Zion to model the Doppler effect in the spectrogram of the seismic records of an air-traffic event.

The methodology and application are described in the following publication:
Meng, Haoran, and Yehuda Ben‚ÄêZion. "Characteristics of airplanes and helicopters recorded by a dense seismic array near Anza California." Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 123.6 (2018): 4783-4797 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JB015240).
